# Configuration

This is done via YAML files. The main file is `config.yml`. Logging behaviour
is configured in `log4rs.yml`. Relevant description is stored in the package's
example logging configuration file.

## `config.yml`

### `store`

See [`store.md`](store.md) for details.

### `web`

All features relating network connectivity and the HTTP protocol.

#### `bind`

The host / IP address and port to which tiny-auth will bind.
E.g. `localhost:8080`.

#### `domain`

The domain under which clients and users can reach tiny-auth. Used for URLs
and cookies.

#### `path`

Optional. The path under which tiny-auth is hosted. If it is deployed on a
subpath below a domain, set the subpath here.

#### `static_files`

Directory storing the HTML et al. files. This directory is usually determined
by the distribution or package maintainer.

#### `session_timeout`

Optional. Timeout for a single authorization session in seconds. Internally this
is the `Max-Age` of the session cookie. Default value is `3600`.

#### `secret_key`

Random string generated by the system administrator. Used to protect the
session cookie.

#### `workers`

Optional. Number of HTTP workers dispatching incoming requests.

#### `tls`

See [`tls.md`](tls.md) for details.

### `crypto`

Configuration of cryptographic material used for secure operation.

#### `pepper`

A secret random string generated by the system administrator. It is used to
secure passwords inside the store. Do not change it once you have clients or
users. Otherwise all passwords are invalidated.

#### `key` and `public key`

Paths to a keypair to sign JWT tokens. Generate them e.g. with openssl:

```bash
openssl genrsa 4096 > key.pem
openssl rsa -in key.pem -pubout > public_key.pem
```

The public key will be hosted by tiny-auth so clients can fetch it and verify
tokens.
