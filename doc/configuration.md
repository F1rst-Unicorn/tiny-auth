# Configuration

This is done via YAML files. The main file is `config.yml`. Logging behaviour
is configured in `log4rs.yml`. Relevant description is stored in the package's
example logging configuration file.

## `config.yml`

### `store`

See [`store.md`](store.md) for details.

### `web`

All features relating network connectivity and the HTTP protocol.

#### `bind`

The host / IP address and port to which tiny-auth will bind.
E.g. `localhost:8080`.

#### `domain`

The domain under which clients and users can reach tiny-auth. Used for URLs
and cookies.

#### `path`

Optional. The path under which tiny-auth is hosted. If it is deployed on a
subpath below a domain, set the subpath here.

#### `static_files`

Directory storing the HTML et al. files. This directory is usually determined
by the distribution or package maintainer.

#### `session_timeout`

Optional. Timeout for a single authorization session in seconds. Internally this
is the `Max-Age` of the session cookie. Default value is `3600`.

#### `secret_key`

Random string generated by the system administrator. Used to protect the
session cookie.

#### `workers`

Optional. Number of HTTP workers dispatching incoming requests.

#### `tls`

See [`tls.md`](tls.md) for details.

### `crypto`

Configuration of cryptographic material used for secure operation.

#### `pepper`

A secret random string generated by the system administrator. It is used to
secure passwords inside the store. Do not change it once you have clients or
users. Otherwise all passwords are invalidated.

#### `key` and `public key`

Paths to a keypair to sign JWT tokens. Supported algorithms are RSA and ECDSA

##### RSA

Use a keysize of at least 4096 bits. Take a look at recent cryptographic
recommendations for a more up-to-date size.

```bash
openssl genrsa 4096 -out key.pem
openssl rsa -in key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem
```

##### ECDSA

Currently only the curve named in the command is supported.

```bash
openssl ecparam -name secp384r1 -genkey -noout | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -out key.pem
openssl ec -in key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem
```
